## 📊 Progress Badges

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-2%2F8%20Tasks%20Complete-yellowgreen)

> ✅ **When new assignments are given**, you will also be told **exactly what to name each file** (e.g., `day3_exercise1_lists.py`), so you can commit them cleanly without having to merge multiple scripts into a single file.

> 🔁 **Automatic Badge Updates:** Whenever a new Markdown progress map is generated, the appropriate progress badges for each topic will also be included, ready to **copy and paste** into the corresponding folder’s `README.md`. These will reflect:
> - Phase/Week Name
> - Number of Exercises Completed
> - Status of the Section (e.g., In Progress, Complete)

> 🔂 **This will now occur automatically after each lesson.**

Example snippet to paste into `1-foundations/README.md`:
